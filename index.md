# Gesture Controlled Lock
I am making a gesture controlled lock that responds using a SparkFun Sensor, and a servo to rotate the lock. The lock has a specific password, a sequence of gestures, that the sensor must receive in order to unlock it. There is also a display to tell the user whether or not the password is correct, and what to do next.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

For my first milestone, I had planned to get the basic components of my project working, and my servo to be able to move. To acheive this, I had to search up tutorials about the different parts of my project and experiment with them. Fortunately, Arduino provided example programs to help me test individual parts of my circuit, which helped me to troubleshoot and figure out which parts of my circuit were malfunctioning. I first got the RGB cathode working, which was useful in getting the scanner set up and working. After I figured out the differences between the power, ground, and signal wires, my . The schematic that I based my design off of had some differences, so I had to adjust my design. I had some trouble with my LCD, but I managed to figure out how to get it functional using another Arduino provided example, which allowed me to isolate the LCD and print "Hello World" to the screen. Once I had the LCD working, it greatly helped me in debugging the rest of my project by printing out the state of my sensor. My sensor caused me a lot of trouble and bugs, but I eventually figured out that the problem was with the connection of the wires, and soldering them fixed it.

# Customized Arduino Circuit 

For my Arduino circuit, I chose to use a button as my input, and an LED as my output. In the Arduino app, I coded it so that the LED would light up whenever I pressed or held the button. I had some trouble with the materials and using a protoshield at first, but I learned how to solder properly and desoldering as well. Eventually, I switched to a breadboard, which was more convenient and user-friendly.
